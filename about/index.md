## About Overture

The mission of the Overture project is twofold: 

- To provide an industrial-strength tool that supports the use of precise abstract models in any VDM dialect for software development.
- To foster an environment that allows researchers and other interested parties to experiment with modifications and extensions to the tool and the different VDM dialects.

## The Overture Community

The Overture tools are being developed by volunteers from industry, research scientists and students, currently from Denmark, England, The Netherlands and Japan. 
You can find an overview of us at our wiki page [The Community](http://wiki.overturetool.org/index.php?title=The_Community).

Anyone interested (from both industry and academia) is welcome to join the project as an active member. 
You might be interested in contributing directly to tools building (via our Overture open source project at Github), or you may be interested in developing the formal foundations of VDM++ and Overture. 
If you are a student (BSc, MSc, PhD), we can provide practical and theoretical projects!

![Overture community at large]({{ site.base }}/images/overturews8.png)  
The Overture community at large (shown above at the 8th Overture workshop on language semantics, held at BCS, London in september 2010) meets together at occasional [Workshops](http://wiki.overturetool.org/index.php/Workshops) (about once per year) and monthly via on-line [Netmeetings](http://wiki.overturetool.org/index.php/NetMeetings) using Skype. 
If you want to join the project please do not hesitate to [send us an e-mail](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01mU5bAq4Rogp5FVouKumLoQ==&c=pHoefT8t8vvgTnqYB_4422-4CEytwUaijr_er5aSbIw=).

## Overture Community Process

In the tradition of open source software development, all contributions to Overture, the language definitions and other aspects, are handled through the Overture Community Process (OCP). 
The Language Board (LB) has elaborated on the "Inititial Consideration" Phase of the OCP and this process is described as the Language Board Process (LBP) description.
