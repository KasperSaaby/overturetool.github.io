#### New GUI Support in Overture (part of the TEMPO project)

A new framework for developing UIs for VDM models with DukeScript has been developed (see <https://github.com/overturetool/tempo-ui>). A very rough proof of concept demo video is available at <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1587375/uidemo.avi>

Two student workers will use this framework to develop a UI for a Traffic Management System model, developed as part of the Tempo project.


#### On-going AU Overture-related student projects

* Magnus Louvmand and Peter Mathiesen: Work on a small project for improving the auto-completion functionality in Overture. The plan is that this will be followed up with a thesis project after summer 2016.
* Kasper Saaby and Rasmus Reimer: Thesis work on a WebIDE for the Overture Platform for example making use of the VDMPad editor but already now capable of support for multiple projects, multiple panes in the editor, navigatable outline, syntax highlighting, error reporting on specific lines and initial support for proof obligation generation. This will be demonstrated to the Software Engineering group on the 10th of February. Project will be completed May 2016.
* Milos Chabada: Thesis work on a GUI Test Automation Environment which is planned to use Overture as a case study.
* Nikolas Bram and Peter Holst: Thesis work with Code Generation Extensions for Overture/VDM towards Typescript/Javascript. Project will be completed by June 2016.
* Steffen Diswal: Thesis work on Code Generation Towards a .NET code contracts and C# Platform. Project will be completed by June 2016.

#### Overture code generation

Lots of internal fixes and extensibility improvements to the code generation platform. All these improvements are based on feedback from the VDM-to-C code generator and the VDM-RT code generator projects. All the technical details related to this are described at <https://github.com/overturetool/overture/issues/491>.

In addition to that we have started updating the Isabelle translator to use the newest code generation platform.

Other than that just some bug fixes in the Java code generator.
