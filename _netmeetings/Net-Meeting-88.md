#### Add a VDM-Util function for getting current system time

See https://github.com/overturetool/language/issues/31

Status of this request for modification remains unchanged.


## Status of VDMTools Development

#### v.9.0.6

There have been no comments from the public on the v9.0.6 release.

##  Status of the Overture Components

#### Java code generation

PVJ has done some work on code generation of VDMSL. Its not yet totally complete as it does not take imports/exports and renaming into account. In addition to that PVJ is also working on generating JML from pre/post/invariants focusing only on SL for now.

#### VDMJ

One small bug fix this time, to prevent the use of "RESULT" in parameter/variable definitions.

#### VDMPad

Recently Tomohiro Oda has developed a python code to animate VDM specs using VDMPad as animation engine. For more information on the project see https://github.com/tomooda/pyVDMC
