## Teaching Material for "Modelling Systems"

We have prepared a set of slides (Microsoft Powerpoint) that can be used for teaching VDM, based on the first edition of the book. It is encouraged to combine the lectures with practical exercises (home work assignments) using Overture or VDMTools Lite which can be downloaded for free from www.vdmtools.jp/en. Teachers are welcome to download and review the material available here. Any use of this material must include acknowledgement of the authors.

The slide collection contains slides for: 

* Introduction Chapter 1

## Other

Slides for explaining:

* the [satisfiability proof obligations for implicitly defined functions/operations]({{site.url}}/publications/training/other/Satisfiability_example.ppt)  
* and for [statebased modelling]({{site.url}}/publications/training/other/10._State-Based_modelling-deliver.ppt). 

Finally a small [tutorial]({{site.url}}/publications/training/other/vdmtools_tutorial1.pdf) for introducing newcommers to VDMTools is available.

## Validation Course

Validation Course (New - July 2000) This course was developed for use at the Technical University of Wroclaw in Poland during 2000 as part of a Socrates Teaching Staff Mobility sponsored by the European Union. Validation Course (62 slides)
