## Teaching Material for "Modelling Systems"

We have prepared a set of slides (Microsoft Powerpoint) that can be used for teaching VDM, based on the first edition of the book. It is encouraged to combine the lectures with practical exercises (home work assignments) using Overture or VDMTools Lite which can be downloaded for free from www.vdmtools.jp/en. Teachers are welcome to download and review the material available here. Any use of this material must include acknowledgement of the authors.
