# Planned Publications

## Planned

#### Conferences / Journals


-   Exploring Alternative Designs using Automated Co-model Analysis
    (Peter, Kenneth, Ken, Carl, and John for a journal)
-   Co-modelling and Co-simulation for an Artificial Cardiac pacemaker
    (John, John Komp, Carl, Martin, Peter, for a workshop?)

## In preparation

-   Methodological Guidelines for Collaborative Modelling - Managing
    Heterogeneous System Complexity (Sune Wolff, need to find new venue)
-   Five Views of a Collaborative Model, (Peter Würtz Vinther Jørgensen
    and Sune Wolff, new venue to be found)
-   The Execution Semantics of VDM Real-Time in a Co-Simulation
    Environment (Kenneth Lausdahl, Joey Coleman and Peter Gorm Larsen,
    new venue needs to be found)
-   Automated translation of VDM to JML annotated Java, (Peter Tran-Jørgensen, Peter Gorm Larsen and Gary Leavens, to be submitted for STTT)
-   Semantics for Generic Co-simulation of Heterogeneous Models (Kenneth
    Lausdahl, Joey Coleman and Peter Gorm Larsen, was rejected from Formal
    Aspects of Computing journal) new version in preparation with Jim Woodcock and Simon Foster

## In review

-   Using Executable VDM++ Models in an Industrial Application (Sune
    Wolff and Peter Gorm Larsen, submitted to defence journal focussing
    on modelling and simulation) (rejected unfortunately)
-   Principles for Reuse in Formal Language Tools, (Luis Diogo Couto, Peter Tran-Jørgensen and Kenneth Lausdahl, submitted for SAC)
