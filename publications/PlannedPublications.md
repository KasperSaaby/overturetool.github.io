# Planned Publications

## Planned

#### Conferences / Journals


-   Exploring Alternative Designs using Automated Co-model Analysis
    (Peter, Kenneth, Ken, Carl, and John for a journal)
-   Co-modelling and Co-simulation for an Artificial Cardiac pacemaker
    (John, John Komp, Carl, Martin, Peter, for a workshop?)

## In preparation

-   Methodological Guidelines for Collaborative Modelling - Managing
    Heterogeneous System Complexity (Sune Wolff, need to find new venue)
-   The Execution Semantics of VDM Real-Time in a Co-Simulation
    Environment (Kenneth Lausdahl, Joey Coleman and Peter Gorm Larsen,
    new venue needs to be found)
-   Semantics for Generic Co-simulation of Heterogeneous Models (Kenneth
    Lausdahl, Joey Coleman and Peter Gorm Larsen, was rejected from Formal
    Aspects of Computing journal) new version in preparation with Jim Woodcock and Simon Foster
-   Integrated Tool Chain for Model-based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems: The INTO-CPS Project, (Peter Gorm Larsen, John Fitzgerald, Jim Woodcock, Peter Fritzson, Jörg Brauer, Christian Kleijn, Thierry Lecomte, Markus Pfeil, Ole Green, Stylianos Basagiannis and Andrey Sadovykh, new venue to be found

## In review
