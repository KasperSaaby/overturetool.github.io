## Modelling Systems: Additional Exercises on Sequences
Exercises 2 & 3 are based on those supplied by Prof. Janusz Laski from Oakland University.

### Basic Exercises

1. Evaluate the following expressions:
1.1 [x | x in set {2,...,5} & x > 2]
1.2 [x | x in set {3,5,2,4} & x*x < 22]
2. Express the following in VDM-SL:
2.1 The sequence L has less than 5 distinct elements.
2.2 The sequence L has no duplicated elements.
2.3 The sequences L1 and L2 are non-empty and are disjoint (i.e. they have no elements in common).
3. Write an explicit function definition for the inds operator.
4. If L is of type seq of (seq of nat), write an expression which says that all the sequences in L are disjoint.
