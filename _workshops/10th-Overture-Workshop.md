10th Overture Workshop on VDM, Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM), Paris, France, 28 August 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Part of [FM2012](http://fm2012.cnam.fr/)

The 10th Overture Workshop on VDM was held in Paris, France, on Tuesday
28 August 2012. The aim of the workshop was to identify and encourage
new collaborative research, and to foster current strands of work
towards publication in the mainstream conferences and journals. VDM is
one of the longest established formal methods, having its origins in
compiler development work in IBM in the 1970s. In the 1990s, the basic
VDM modelling language was standardized by ISO and the first commercial
tools emerged. Since 2000, the method has been extended to support
object-orientation, concurrency, real-time and distribution. A notable
recent advance has been the use of VDM as a base language for modelling
systems-of-systems (SOS) [COMPASS](http://www.compass-research.eu/).

The community-based Overture initiative is developing an
industry-strength tool on a new open platform, exploiting research
mainly in Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands and Portugal. Research in
Overture is making advances in proof support and the need to interface
VDM models of discrete event systems with heterogeneous models from
other engineering disciplines, such as continuous time models of
controlled plants [Destecs](http://www.destecs.org).

The Overture initiative held its first workshop at FM’05. Workshops were
held subsequently at FM'06, FM'08 and FM'09, FM'11 and in between. The
most recent (9th) workshop, co-located with FM'11, included several
reports of development in control and embedded systems design. The 10th
Overture workshop emphasized topics that mesh closely with the themes of
FM 2012 itself, particularly application experience in industry,
validation of tools and methods and the development of tools.

### Program

The morning program consisted of an introduction given by Nico Plat
([Slides](Overture_10th_workshop_intro.ppt "wikilink")), followed by a
number of paper presentations. These included:

-   "The Co-Simulation of a Cardiac Pacemaker using VDM and 20-sim"
    (Carl Gamble, Martin Mansfield, and John Fitzgerald)
    [Slides](FM-20120-Pacemaker.pdf‎ "wikilink")
-   "Supporting the Partitioning Process in Hardware/Software Co-design
    with VDM-RT" (José Antonio Esparza Isasa, Peter Gorm Larsen and Kim
    Bjerge) [Slides](Jaei_OvertureWorkshop.pdf‎ "wikilink")
-   "Evolution of the Overture Tool Platform" (Joey Coleman, Anders
    Kaels Malmos, Claus Ballegaard Nielsen and Peter Gorm Larsen)
    [Slides](evo.pdf‎ "wikilink")
-   "Towards an extensible core model for Digital Rights Management in
    VDM" (Rasmus W. Lauritsen and Lasse Lorenzen)
    [Slides](Overture_10th_DrmPresentation.pdf‎ "wikilink")
-   "Towards a Co-simulation Semantics of VDM-RT/Overture and 20-sim"
    (Joey Coleman, Kenneth Lausdahl and Peter Gorm Larsen)
    [Slides](Vdmrt-semanticsPresentation.pdf‎ "wikilink")
-   "Initial Report of the Impact of Using Overture/VDM in a Development
    Process in an Architecture-Oriented Approach" (Shigeru Kusakabe,
    Yoich Omori and Keijiro Araki)
    [Slides](PersonalSoftwareProcessUsingVDM_pub.pdf "wikilink")

The afternoon was dedicated to getting hands-on experience with the
Overture platform. The intention of this was to get more developers able
to (and interested in) actively contributing to the further development
of the Overture toolset.

The session was started with a few short presentations:

-   "The Overture AST and Plug-in Development" (Kenneth Lausdahl) [
    Slides](Overture10_ASTGen_and_plugin_creation.pdf‎ "wikilink"),
    [Tutorial 1 Java
    Source](http://build.overturetool.org/builds/Overture-Workshop10/Overture10_plugin_tutorial1.zip),
    [Tutorial 1 VDM
    Source](http://build.overturetool.org/builds/Overture-Workshop10/Overture10_tutorial1_vdm_model.zip),
    [Screencase](http://staff.iha.dk/pgl/overture%20plugin/overture%20plugin.html)
-   "The Inner Workings of Overture-core" (Kenneth Lausdahl)
    [Slides](The_inner_workings_of_overture_core.pdf‎ "wikilink")
    [Screencast](http://staff.iha.dk/pgl/Inner%20workings%20of%20Overture/Inner%20workings%20of%20Overture.html)
-   "The build process, using Git and the dependencies" (Joey Coleman).
    [Slides](Build_process.pdf‎ "wikilink")
    [Screencast](http://staff.iha.dk/pgl/Overture%20Build%20Process/Overture%20Build%20Process.html)
-   "Next Generation Showtrace" (Peter W.V. Joergensen)
    [Slides](ShowtraceNextGeneration.pdf‎ "wikilink")
-   "State Machines ... VDM" (Marcel Verhoef)
    [Slides](Overture10_StateMachines.pdf‎ "wikilink")

After these presentations the workshop participants got the opportunity
to get hands-on experience working with development and compilation of
different aspects chosen individually by each participant. In this
process the core developers helped the participants in order to enable
more people to contribute to this Open Source initiative after the
workshop.
