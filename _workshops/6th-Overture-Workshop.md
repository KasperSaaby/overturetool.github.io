# {{ page.title }}

This workshop was organised at the University of Newcastle in the UK and
took place between 7-8 May 2009. The overall theme of this workshop was
to exercise different aspects of developing software for the Overture
open source platform on top of Eclipse. In order to compile the Overture
executables different steps need to be taken to produce subprojects
[without the Eclipse
interface](Overture Maven Core Components Guide.pdf "wikilink") or [with
the Eclipse
interface](Overture Maven Eclipse plugin Guide.pdf "wikilink"). The
aspects that will be covered included:

-   Kernel functionality developed on top of the abstract syntax using
    VDM++ and with code generation to java
-   User interface functionality focusing on how to develop Eclipse
    plug-ins
-   Testing using VDMUnit and JUnit of Overture components.
