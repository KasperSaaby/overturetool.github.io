Third Overture Workshop

27-28 November 2006

Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

Background
----------

There was a lot of activity around tools and applications of VDM in
2005-6. However, apart from the tools work, there are several drivers
that lead us to consider new research directions in the semantics and
foundations of VDM's version of formal, yet lightweight and applicable
methods. The aim of this workshop was to form collaborative links and
concrete plans for research directions related to, but not confined to,
VDM. Topics included:

-   Drivers from application areas: distributed systems, concurrency,
    real-time.
-   Semantics Support: underpinning logics, type theory, static
    analysis, proof theory, proof technology.
-   Methodological Issues: links to other design formalisms,
    interoperability.

Outcomes
--------

We decided to pursue research in three main streams, each of which has a
group:

-   Semantics: Initial topics include VDM++ semantics (based on the
    definition of a kernel language) and proof theory development. The
    group will be convened by John Fitzgerald and will initially include
    Bernhard Aichernig, Joey Coleman, Peter Gorm larsen and Jose
    Oliveira.
-   Tools: The group will be convened by Peter Gorm Larsen.
-   Methods and Applications: Bernhard Aichernig and Nico Plat will
    convene a group on methods and applications, looking initially at
    the links between VDM++ and JML.

Cutting across the activities of the three groups, we will start work on
VDM/Overture approaches to the Grand challenges, with the first of these
being the Mondex study, led by Jeremy Bryans. We will go on to pursue
the Posix fault tolerant file store example next.
