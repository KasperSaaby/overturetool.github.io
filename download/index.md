In case you experience problems, there are two options for you to get support, directly from the Overture developers. 
You can either post a question on the [StackOverflow with the VDM++ tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vdm%2b%2b) or [send us an e-mail](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01mU5bAq4Rogp5FVouKumLoQ==&c=pHoefT8t8vvgTnqYB_4422-4CEytwUaijr_er5aSbIw=).

## Checking for updates

There are two ways to keep the Overture tool in sync with the project releases. 
First one is simple: just repeat the steps described above, by manually downloading and installing the latest version from SourceForge. 
Multiple versions of the Overture tool can happily co-exist as long as you install them in seperate directories! 
The second option is also simple and well-known to Eclipse users, by moving to the Help menu and select _Check for Updates_. 
This will upgrade the currently running tool instance to the latest and greatest.




## Extending the Overture tool

The Overture tool is based on Eclipse, and can be extended through Eclipse plug-ins. For example, it is very easy to add the [Subclipse plug-in](http://subclipse.tigris.org) to Overture, such that you can put your specifications under revision control using subversion.

## Integration with other tools

There are a few tools that provide an integration interface to the Overture tools. They are only required if you wish to use specific features of the Overture tool. They are not required for the basic functionality.

- Latex can be used to produce documentation. On Linux, this is known to work with TeTeX, on Windows we have used [MikTex](http://miktex.org) successfully.
- Overture tool provides functionality to read and write UML 2.0 interchange files using the XMI file format. This has been tested and shown to work with [Enterprise Architect](http://www.sparxsystems.com).
- Overture tools provides a coupling to [VDMTools](http://www.vdmtools.jp/en).

For further details, we refer to the User Guide, which can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/files/OvertureIDEUserGuide.pdf).
