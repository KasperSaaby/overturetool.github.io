## Welcome to the Overture tool project

Overture is a community-based project developing the next generation of open-source tools to support modelling and analysis in the design of computer-based systems. Overture supports  [VDM: The Vienna Development Method](http://www.vdmportal.org/), a set of modelling techniques with a long and successful history of industrial application and research. 
Overture is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing VDM models. 
The Overture tools are written entirely in Java and build on top of the Eclipse platform. 
Overture supports the following VDM language dialects:

- VDM-SL: the VDM Specification Language, [ISO/IEC 13817-1:1996](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=22988), with extensions for modules
- VDM-PP: Object oriented extension of VDM-SL, also known as VDM++
- VDM-RT: Extension of VDM++ for specifying real-time and distributed systems 


| The current stable version is **2.0.2**  (December 2013) which you can [download here]({{ site.base }}download/).|
