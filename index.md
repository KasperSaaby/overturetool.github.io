# Welcome to the Overture Tool Project

Overture is a community-based project developing the next generation
of open-source tools to support modelling and analysis in the design
of computer-based systems. Overture supports
[VDM: The Vienna Development Method](http://www.vdmportal.org/), a set
of modelling techniques with a long and successful history of
industrial application and research.  Overture is an integrated
development environment (IDE) for developing VDM models.  The Overture
tools are written entirely in Java and built on top of the Eclipse
platform.  Overture supports the following VDM language dialects:

- VDM-SL: the VDM Specification Language,
  [ISO/IEC 13817-1:1996](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=22988),
  with extensions for modules
- VDM-PP: Object oriented extension of VDM-SL, also known as VDM++
- VDM-RT: Extension of VDM++ for specifying real-time and distributed
  systems
