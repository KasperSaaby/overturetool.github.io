### CarNaviRadio

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Marcel Verhoef|
|**Version:**|VDM_RT - classic|
||The origin of the car radio navigation example comes from MarcelVerhoef as a part of his PhD thesis where it was used to comparydifferent formalisms. This example shows how an embedded applicationwith both radio, navigation and traffic messages are joined in onecoherent application in a distributed application.|

|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Marcel Verhoef and Bert Bos and Ken Pierce|
|**Version:**|VDM_RT - classic|
||This example shows the discrete event model used forco-simulation of the ChessWay personal people moveras used in the DESTECS project (see http://www.destecs.org).It reflects the status of the model which is mentionedin the paper <I>A Formal Approach to Collaborative Modellingand Co-simulation for Embedded Systems</I> which is submittedto the Journal Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.The corresponding continuous time model is availablethrough the first author.|

|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Peter Gorm Larsen and Marcel Verhoef|
|**Version:**|VDM_RT - classic|
||This example is used in the guidelines for developing distributed real time systems using the VICE extension to VDM++. This model is available in a sequential version, a concurrent version aswell as in a distributed real-time VICE version. This is the distributed real time version of this example. |

### CyberRail

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Jasper Nygaard and Rasmus Sørensen|
|**Version:**|VDM_RT - classic|
||﻿This VDM-RT model was produced as a part of an MSn thesis investigating and analyzingthe possibility of obtaining early stage validation of potential candidate system architectures, by means of formal modelling and validation. The goal was to analyze recent research extensions of VDM++ for describing and analyzing such distributed systems (VDM-RT) and see if the language is suitable to stress test a distributed system and validate any architectural benefits. Additionally this thesis discussesfavorable approaches for realizing a case study of a transportation system in Tokyo, referred to as CyberRail. Different VDM++ models of candidate architectures for the CyberRail system has been developed and validated. This thesis includes 2 Real-Time VDM++ models (Backend Responsibility source, Joint Responsibility source), based on 2 different architectures. |

### Iioss

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Christian Thillemann and Bardur Joensen|
|**Version:**|VDM_RT - classic|
||This project was made by Christian Thillemann and Bardur Joensen in aVDM course. It is modelling a small subset of a controller for a pig stable that wish to keep track of the whereabouts of a collection of pigsin a stable.|

### MSAW

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Augusto Ribeiro|
|**Version:**|VDM_RT - classic|
||This example is created by Augusto Ribeiro illustrating different concepts in VDM for teaching purposes including the distributed real time features in VDM-RT. Notethat thus this model is not in a state where it makes sense to execute it.|

### Oldcarradio

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Marcel Verhoef|
|**Version:**|VDM_RT - classic|
||This was the first model Marcel Verhoef tried to make of the carradio navigation example using the original version of VICE withone CPU. This failed and as a consequence Marcel Verhoef and PeterGorm Larsen came up with an improved version of VDM-RT with multiple CPUs connected with BUSses.|
