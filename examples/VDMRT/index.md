### CarNaviRadio
The origin of the car radio navigation example comes from Marcel
Verhoef as a part of his PhD thesis where it was used to compary
different formalisms. This example shows how an embedded application
with both radio, navigation and traffic messages are joined in one
coherent application in a distributed application.

### CarNaviRadioValConj
This example is a modified version of the car radio navigation
example. It demonstrates the use of validation conjectures.

### ChessWay
This example shows the discrete event model used for
co-simulation of the ChessWay personal people mover
as used in the DESTECS project (see http://www.destecs.org).
It reflects the status of the model which is mentioned
in the paper <I>A Formal Approach to Collaborative Modelling
and Co-simulation for Embedded Systems</I> which is submitted
to the Journal Mathematical Structures in Computer Science.
The corresponding continuous time model is available
through the first author.

### CM
This example is used in the guidelines for developing distributed 
real time systems using the VICE extension to VDM++. This model 
is available in a sequential version, a concurrent version as
well as in a distributed real-time VICE version. This is the 
distributed real time version of this example.

### CyberRail
﻿This VDM-RT model was produced as a part of an MSn thesis investigating and analyzing
the possibility of obtaining early stage validation of potential candidate system 
architectures, by means of formal modelling and validation. The goal was to analyze 
recent research extensions of VDM++ for describing and analyzing such distributed 
systems (VDM-RT) and see if the language is suitable to stress test a distributed 
system and validate any architectural benefits. Additionally this thesis discusses
favorable approaches for realizing a case study of a transportation system in Tokyo, 
referred to as CyberRail. Different VDM++ models of candidate architectures for the 
CyberRail system has been developed and validated. This thesis includes 2 Real-Time 
VDM++ models (Backend Responsibility source, Joint Responsibility source), based 
on 2 different architectures.

### HomeAutomation
This is a distributed real-time version of a home automation example constructed
by Sune Wolff.

of Distributed Real-Time Embedded Systems Using VDM, International Journal of

### Iioss
This project was made by Christian Thillemann and Bardur Joensen in a
VDM course. It is modelling a small subset of a controller for a pig 
stable that wish to keep track of the whereabouts of a collection of pigs
in a stable.

### MSAW
This example is created by Augusto Ribeiro illustrating different concepts in VDM 
for teaching purposes including the distributed real time features in VDM-RT. Note
that thus this model is not in a state where it makes sense to execute it.

### Oldcarradio
This was the first model Marcel Verhoef tried to make of the car
radio navigation example using the original version of VICE with
one CPU. This failed and as a consequence Marcel Verhoef and Peter
Gorm Larsen came up with an improved version of VDM-RT with 
multiple CPUs connected with BUSses.

### Pacemaker
This model is made by Hugo Macedo as a part of his MSc thesis of a
pacemaker according to the grand challenge provided by Boston
Scientific in this area. This is the last of a series of VDM models
of the pacemaker and it incorporates a number of modes for the 
pacemaker. More information can be found in:

### Robot
This example was produced by Lasse Lorentzen and Kenneth Lausdahl
as a part of a VDM course of a robot travelling autonomically inside
a cave aiming at avioding different obstacles on its path.

### VeMo
﻿This example was used in the MSc thesis for Claus Ballegaard
Nielsen in order to illustrate how dynamic deployment with advantage 
could be added to VDM-RT.
