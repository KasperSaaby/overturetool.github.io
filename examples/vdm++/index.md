### Alarm++proof

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen|
|**Version:**|VDM_PP - classic|
||This is a version of the alarm example from the VDM++ book, John Fitzgerald, Peter Gorm Larsen, Paul Mukherjee, Nico Plat and Marcel Verhoef, Validated Designs for Object-oriented Systems, Springer, New York. 2005, ISBN 1-85233-881-4. This version of the example has been used for proof purposes and thus the operations in the normal VDM++ of this example are made as functions just like in the VDM-SLversion of the alarm example. The example is inspired by a subcomponent of a large alarm system developed by IFAD A/S. It is modelling the management of alarms for an industrial plant. The purpose of the model is to clarify the rules governing the duty roster and calling out of experts to deal with alarms. |

### AutomatedStockBroker

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Anders Kaels Malmos|
|**Version:**|VDM_PP - classic|
||The system is an automated stock broker, where you can specify a listof stocks which automaticly, can either be bought or sold. This isdone by defining a prioritised list of stocks to observe, which eachhas defined a trigger that tells in which situation the system shouldreact with either a buy or a sell action. The trigger is a ruledefined upon the history and the current value of the stock. Thismodel is made by Anders Kaels Malmos as a small mini-project in acourse on "Modelling of Mission Critical Systems" (seehttps://services.brics.dk/java/courseadmin/TOMoMi/pages/Modelling+of+Mission+Critical+Systems).

|**Author:**|Niels Kirkegaard|
|**Version:**|VDM_PP - classic|

The VDM++ specification is inspired by a KLVdescription provided to the EP26538 FMERail project as case study byAtelier B.  This model shows an example of how an informal descriptioncan be translated into a precise model that together with a graphicalfront-end can be used to ensure that the customer and the developerhave a common interpretation of the system under development.The focus of the model is on the logic of the KLV systems when a trainmeets speed restriction beacons along the tracks, i.e. on events thattriggers the KLV system. Issues such as how to determine whether abeacon has been met within a certain distance calculated from speedhas been abstracted in away in the current model. They could be issuesto extend the model with.|

### SAFER

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Sten Agerholm and Peter Gorm Larsen|
|**Version:**|VDM_PP - classic|
||This specification is a VDM++ model of the SAFER (Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue) example presented in the second volume of the NASA guidebook on formal methods. Here Appendix C contains a complete listing of the SAFER system using PVS. We have translated this PVS specification rather directly into VDM-SL previously and here that model is again moved to VDM++. In the VDM++ model we have abstracted away form a number of parts which has been left as uninterpreted functions in the PVS model. This has been done because we have defined the purpose of the model to clarify the functionality of the thruster selection logic and the protocol for the automatic attitude hold functionality. Otherwise we have on purpose varied as little as possible from the given PVS model. In order to visualise this example the dynamic link feature is illustrated as well. In the test class Test there are a few examples of using the traces primitives used for test automation. More explanation about this work can be found in the papers:  *Sten Agerholm and Peter Gorm Larsen, Modeling and   Validating SAFER in VDM-SL, ed: Michael Holloway,   in "Fourth NASA Langley Formal Methods Workshop",   NASA, September 1997.  *Sten Agerholm and Wendy Schafer, Analyzing SAFER using   UML and VDM++, ed: John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen,   in "VDM Workshop at the Formal Methods 1999 conference,   Toulouse |

||This example illustrates how one can define the rules for calculating who will qualify in the world championship in soccer given different initial groups. This model is made for the championship in 2000 but it could easily be updated to reflect the any championships.
