|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Paul Mukherjee|
|**Version:**|classic|
||This specification describes the safety requirements involved in adding and removing explosives at an explosives storage site. The specification is based on United Kingdom Ministry of Defence regulations concerning safe storage of explosives, which in turn are based on UN regulations. Details of the specification may be found in:   1. P. Mukherjee and V. Stavridou, "The Formal Specification of Safety    Requirements for the Storage of Explosives", technical report DITC 185/91,    National Physical Laboratory, 1991. 2. P. Mukherjee and V. Stavridou, "The Formal Specification of Safety    Requirements for Storing Explosives", Formal Aspects of Computing,    5(4):299-336, 1993. This example is primarily specified using the implicit style in VDM so itdoes not have a main debug functionality.|

|**Author:**|Nick Battle, Peter Gorm Larsen and Claus Ballegaard Nielsen (animation)|
|**Version:**|vdm10|
||Conway's Game of LifeThe universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.At each step in time, the following transitions occur: *   Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population. *   Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. *   Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. *   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed-births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.|

###DFDexample

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Peter Gorm Larsen|
|**Version:**|classic|
||This specification describes how one can automatically transform DataFlow Diagrams (DFD) into VDM-SL definitions. It is written as a flatVDM-SL model in a purely executable style. However, in order to testit at the top level one needs to construct a large test structurewhich essentially is an AST for a DFD. This have been done in the pastbut unfortunately the sources for this have been lost. This model wasbasis for a paper published as:"A Formal Semantics of Data Flows Diagrams", P.G.Larsen, N.Plat, H.Toetenel, Formal Aspects of Computing'' 1994, Vol 6, December|

###Express

| | |
|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Marcel Verhoef|
|**Version:**|classic|
||The (building) industry in Europe currently uses the ISO-STEP standard to define information models with the aim to exchange data about those information models. The ISO-STEP standard contains the EXPRESS modelling language and several programming language bindings and an ASCII neutral format to implement interfaces to those models. Unfortunately, industry has not reached consensus on a particular information model, therefore multiple models exist. This raises the need to migrate instances from one model to another and vice-versa, commonly referred to as the "mapping". The aim of this exercise was to determine the applicability of VDM-SL with respect to these types of problems. For more details on the mapping issue down-loadable copies of two papers resulting from this research is available. The example shows a simple VDM-SL abstract syntax representation of the ISO STEP part 21 physical file format and a transformation process for a particular set of abstract syntax instances. It implements a mapping between the relational model representation (rmrep) into a simple polynomial representation. |

It wascreated by IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn and described in U.S. Patent No. 2,950,048, filed onJanuary 6, 1954, and granted on August 23, 1960.The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is specified in ISO/IEC 7812-1.[1]It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect againstaccidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbersuse the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from collections of random digits.|

||In this specification a model of interlocking systems is presented,and it is describe how the model may be validated bysimulation. Station topologies are modelled by graphs in which thenodes denote track segments, and the edges denote connectivity fortrain traffic. Points and signals are modelled by annotations on theedges, thereby restricting the driving possibilities. We define thesafe station states as predicates on the graph, and present a firststep towards an implementation of these predicates. The modeldevelopment illustrates how concepts may be captured and validated fora non-trivial system. This work was conducted by Kirsten Mark Hansenwork for the Danish State Railways.

|**Author:**|Nick Battle|
|**Version:**|classic|
||This example was produced by Nick Battle and it is used in the VDMJ usermanual to illustrate different features of VDMJ. It models the behaviourof the 32-bit shared memory quadrants of HP-UX, using a record type M to represent a block of memory which is either <FREE> or <USED>, and a sequence of M records to represent a Quadrant.The specification output indicates which allocation policy, first-fit or best-fit (or neither), produces the most memory fragmentation.|

|**Author:**|V. S. Alagar \and D. Muthiayen|
|**Version:**|classic|
||The simulator specified in VDM-SL in this example is the main component of an animation tool designed for use in the validation of complex real-time reactive systems described using TROM (Timed Reactive Object Model) formalism. We include two versions of the specifications; Section 2 contains the version in which implicit operations are used, and most of the operations are rewritten as explicit operations in the version contained in Section 3.|

|**Version:**|classic|
||?This tutorial example is taken out of a VDM course given to the students of the Dipl?me d'Etudes Sup�rieures Sp?cialis?es en G?nie Informatique (5th year) at the Universit? Joseph Fourier. A first version uses the implicit style of specification of VDM-SL and thus may not be executed with VDMTools. An explicit version is given as an appendix. |

###Telephone

|------|-------|
|**Author:**|Bernhard Aichernig|
|**Version:**|classic|
||This example due to Abrial has been translated from the B-notation into VDM-SL. It demonstrates how an event-based system may be modeled using the specification language of the Vienna Development Method. In the following, operations specify the events which can be initiated either by the system or by a subscriber (user). An implicit style using pre- and post-conditions has been chosen, in order to model the system's state transitions. The model of the telephone exchange is centred around a set of subscribers who may be engaged in telephone conversations through a network controlled by an exchange. |

|------|-------|
|**Author:**|John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen|
|**Version:**|classic|
||The tracker example is used in the mapping chapter of the VDM-SLbook by John Fitzgerald and Peter Gorm Larsen to introduce mappings and mapping operators concerns a system for tracking the movement of containers of hazardous material between phases of processing in a nuclear reprocessing plant. It is inspired by the formal model of a plant controller architecture developed by Manchester Informatics Ltd. in collaboration with British Nuclear Fuels (Engineering) Ltd. (BNFL) in 1995. More can be read about this in:J.S. Fitzgerald and C.B. Jones, Proof in VDM: Case Studies, Chapter: Proof in the Validation of a Formal Model of a Tracking System for a Nuclear Plant, Springer-Verlag,FACIT Series, 1998.|
