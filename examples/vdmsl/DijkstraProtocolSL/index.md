title: DijkstraProtocolSL

Author: Peter Gorm Larsen


This small specification is based on a protocol made
by Dijkstra for termination of different processes in
a distributed setting (see [Dijkstra83]). This academic
example was used at a Dagstuhl workshop about "Integration 
of Tools for Rigorous Software Construction and Analysis"
(http://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=13372)
The algorithm here was used to compare different formal
notations including VDM-SL.

[Dijkstra83] EWD 840: "Derivation of a termination detection 
algorithm for distributed computations" was published as
Information Processing Letters 16: 217ï¿½219, 1983. See
